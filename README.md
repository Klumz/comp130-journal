This paper introduces a new technique called "Emotion Sensory World", where human emotions are analysed and detected through machine eyes. This is done by a camera taking an image of said eye, processes it using a texture filtering algorithm, then is finally compared with the list of images stores in database. Examples of the emotional distinctions include: 

Happiness: Relaxed and neutral eyes

Anger: Eyebrows are pulled down and inward

Surprise: Eyebrows are raised and curved.
