# Blue Eyes Technology

## Introduction
Humans depend on their ability to perceive, interpret, and react to information. However, could such sensory abilities be implemented for computers? This is where blue eyes technology comes into play. It is the technology built for analysing, detecting, and reacting accordingly to human emotions used with various electronic gadgets, such as a camera. This technology aims to enable computational machines to absorb and interact with humans based on their emotional information, allowing a natural interaction between the two. The **blue** in **blue eyes** stands for 'bluetooth', which is what enables wireless communication. **Eyes** simply refers to human eyes and their ability to move and gather information. Related methods are speech and facial recognition. 

## Emotion Sensors
Different types of sensors have been created to capture emotional states from users.

This paper introduces a new technique called "Emotion Sensory World", where human emotions are analysed and detected through machine eyes. This is done by a camera taking an image of said eye, processes it using a texture filtering algorithm, then is finally compared with the list of images stores in database. Examples of the emotional distinctions include: 

Happiness: Relaxed and neutral eyes

Anger: Eyebrows are pulled down and inward

Surprise: Eyebrows are raised and curved.

This paper presents an approach for emotion detection in heavily [noisy images](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image_noise), focusing on removal of noise from said images. The emotions used are anger, fear, happiness and neutral.
